# Hugvi

A note-taking app, created using `Tauri` and `React`. This app is for desktop only.

**Hugvi** is not just a note-taking app. The core idea behind it was to allow developers to store code snippets with
nice and easy syntax highlighting.
What are the features of Hugvi?

1. Everything is stored locally using SQLite, so your data are private.
2. The UI and functionalities of **Hugvi** are kept simple.
3. Multilanguage. Supported languages are: English, German, French.

Behind the scenes, **Hugvi** is powered by the `Tauri` framework, which uses `Rust` for greater speed and control.
